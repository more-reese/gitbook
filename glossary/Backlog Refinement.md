| Definition              | Purpose | Duration |
| --------------------    | ---------- | ---------- |
| Backlog refinement should be done continuously by the Product Owner and Scrum Master. Since the PM and EM take on those responsibilities at Foundry, we require a backlog grooming event, before planning, to ensure coordination. | The primary purpose is to ensure the next few sprints worth of User Stories in the Product Backlog are prepared for Sprint Planning. | Product Manager, Engineering Manager |


## Notes:
•Review the strategic purpose behind prioritized items in the backlog
•Make sure User Stories are small enough to be taken on during a sprint
•Ensure User Stories are detailed appropriately and have clear acceptance criteria
•A User Story should be 80% complete before taking it to the full team
•Fully review and understand the User Stories' technical considerations
