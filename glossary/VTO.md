There are two disciplines or tools we teach to help make sure your vision is shared by all:

**Discipline #1: State of the Company** – The first discipline is a quarterly [State of the Company](https://www.eosworldwide.com/blog/3683/eos/your-vision-shared-all/) message, where you actually share your Vision and Plan with every single person in your company. The simple fact is, you can’t get people to share your Vision unless you tell them what your Vision is. Because most of us employ humans, and humans need to hear things seven times to hear and understand them for the first time, we need to do it over and over again – every word, every quarter.

**Discipline #2: Departmental Plan** – At a company’s first two-day Annual, we ask leaders to consider using another tool or discipline – a Departmental Plan – to strengthen the company’s Vision component. Once the V/TO is complete and the leadership team is on the same page, we suggest that each member of the leadership team use the Traction® page (page 2) of a blank V/TO template to clearly define a 1-Year Plan, Quarterly measurables and Rocks, and a long-term Issues List for their departments. In other words, a “Departmental Plan.”

This powerful approach pays three important dividends:

1.  **It drives ownership of and accountability for achieving the company’s Vision to the next level(s) of the organization.** Once the company’s Vision and Plan are clear, each leader and team must crystallize the numbers, Goals and Rocks that will ensure the company hits its measurables and completes its Goals and Rocks.
2.  **It creates a common language and set of tools for the entire organization.** People at all levels of the organization become more familiar with key EOS® concepts and tools, like the V/TO, a 1-Year Plan, quarterly Rocks, and compartmentalizing Issues.
3.  **It helps each team execute better on its own priorities.** The Traction page of a V/TO defines success for this year and this quarter. It forces the establishment of 3 – 7 priorities each year and each quarter. It keeps teams and team members focused on and accountable for hitting the department’s measurables and completing the team’s priorities.
