# RPC

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, which is a protocol that allows a computer program to call a subroutine or function on another computer or server over a network, as if it were a local function call.

In an RPC system, the calling program sends a request message to the remote server containing the name of the function to be executed and its parameters. The remote server executes the function and returns the result to the calling program, which can then continue its execution.

RPC is often used in client-server architectures, where a client program running on one computer requests a service or resource from a server program running on another computer. Examples of applications that use RPC include distributed file systems, database systems, and web services.

There are several RPC protocols, including the Remote Procedure Call Protocol (RPCP) developed by Sun Microsystems, the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) developed by the Object Management Group (OMG), and the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) developed by Microsoft.
